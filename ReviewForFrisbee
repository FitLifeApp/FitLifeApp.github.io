  Errors say the issue is that the database can't be connected to
  Debugging shows the problem lies in line 169 of Main.java
    dbConnection = DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:mysql://localhost/?user=root&password=Digby1097");
    throws SQLException
Note: After installing MySQL, the error changed from not being able to connect to access being denied when starting.
    Still doesn't work though
